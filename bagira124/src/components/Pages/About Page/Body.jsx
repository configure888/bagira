              BAGIRA is a 28 year-old selftaught artist based in Curaçao. She
              quit job as a sales agent at an accountant firm 2 weeks after she
              discovered her talent and decided to paint full time based on
              portrait commission work. After a while she started giving classes
              and discovered her love for murals. Within her carreer of just 8
              years as an independent artist, she is now one of the most
              renowned artists of Curaçao. Painting mostly portraits of
              imaginary and real people, she captures the beauty in a sense that
              leaves most viewers in awe. BAGIRA grew up all around the world,
              being born to Hunagrian mother and Algerian father, before she
              turned 19 and moved to Curaçao to live with her big sister, she
              lived in the Netherlands, Hungary, Algeria and Belgium which had a
              huge effect on the way she views people and cultures, especially
              being Kabyle, an Indigenous North-African. When life got tough and
              she found herself living on her own when she was only 16 years
              old, she had no other option than to become independent in many
              ways, which led to her fearless character.
